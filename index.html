    You won't belive how crazy these dinos are!

    <p>Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that lived on Earth for over 160 million years, long before humans
        appeared. They first emerged during the Triassic period, expanded dramatically during the Jurassic, and
        dominated the planet until their sudden extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period about 66 million years
        ago. During this vast timespan, they evolved into a wide range of sizes, shapes, and lifestyles.</p>

    <p id="pinkparagraph">Some dinosaurs were enormous plant-eaters, like *Brachiosaurus* and *Triceratops*, which spent their days grazing
        on vegetation. Others were agile predators, such as *Velociraptor* and the famous *Tyrannosaurus rex*, which
        used their speed, strength, and sharp teeth or claws to hunt prey. Their adaptations helped them thrive in
        forests, plains, deserts, and even polar regions.</p>
    <p>Not all dinosaurs were gigantic. Many species were the size of modern birds or small mammals, and scientists now
        know that feathers were common on several types of dinosaurs. In fact, birds are the direct descendants of one
        branch of feathered, two-legged dinosaurs called theropods. That means dinosaurs are not entirely extinct—every
        bird alive today is technically a small, modern dinosaur.</p>
